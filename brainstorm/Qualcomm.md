## Original Concept (Technical Details)ity Assistant (Local, Agentic, MCP-Driven)**

A local Windows-based assistant that uses **Edge AI** and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to help users:

1. **Control browser tabs** via natural language (e.g., "Close all YouTube tabs").
2. **Manage tasks and calendar** (e.g., "Remind me to call mom tomorrow at 5pm").

### Key Features:

* üí° **Runs fully offline** using a lightweight LLM like **Phi-3** or **Mistral**.
* üß† **Agentic behavior** powered by **MCP**: tools for tabs, tasks, and calendar are called autonomously by the model.
* üìÇ **Local memory and tool registry**: JSON or vector DB for context, no cloud dependencies.
* üñ•Ô∏è **UI for interaction** (optional): voice or text, via PyQt5 or Electron.

### Why it‚Äôs compelling:

* Fully edge-based, private, and modular.
* Demonstrates real-world productivity use cases.
* Ideal for the ‚ÄúEdge AI‚Äù or ‚ÄúEnterprise Agent‚Äù hackathon tracks.
