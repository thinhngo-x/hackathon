## 🛒 **Agent-Powered Second-Hand Marketplace**

A conversational, AI-driven marketplace where users can **buy, sell, and discover second-hand items** through a **personalized agent** that builds and maintains a user profile in the form of a **knowledge graph**.

---

### 🎯 **Core Features**

#### 1. **Conversational Commerce Interface**

* Users interact via **natural language or voice**:

  * “Find a used iPhone in my area under \$300.”
  * “List my PS5 with auto-generated description.”
* Built-in **agentic reasoning** helps refine queries and suggest better alternatives.

#### 2. **Personalized User Profiles (Knowledge Graph)**

* The assistant builds a persistent **user profile graph** from:

  * Preferences (e.g., price range, brands)
  * Location, past interactions, search patterns
  * Item categories of interest
* This profile adapts and is used to customize searches and recommendations.

#### 3. **AI-Powered Listing Assistant**

* Sellers upload an image and get:

  * Auto-generated titles, descriptions, and tags
  * Price suggestions based on market data
  * Estimated demand and time-to-sell predictions

#### 4. **Smart Negotiation Agent**

* Buyers can delegate negotiations to an AI agent that:

  * Makes and tracks offers
  * Suggests fair counteroffers
  * Prioritizes purchases based on urgency or value

#### 5. **Visual Search & Multimodal Input (Optional)**

* Snap a photo of a product → Find similar second-hand listings.
* Combine text + image: “Find chairs like this under \$100.”

#### 6. **Voice-First Interface (Bonus)**

* Voice-based assistant for browsing, listing, and negotiating.
* Ideal for mobile or embedded contexts (like smart home devices).

### 🛠️ **Architecture Overview**

* **Frontend**: React or Tauri for web/native cross-platform UI
* **Backend**: FastAPI with LangGraph (MCP support)
* **LLM**: On-device (Edge) or hosted (OpenRouter/Vultr) using Mistral or GPT-4
* **Storage**:

  * Vector DB (Chroma or Weaviate) for listings and user profiles
  * Graph DB or JSON-LD for knowledge graph
* **Optional APIs**:

  * SERP or eBay for price estimation
  * Tavily for retrieving trends
  * Twilio for voice/sms interfaces

### ✅ **Why It Stands Out**

* **Solves a real pain** in second-hand markets: poor UX, spam, hard-to-find items.
* **Truly agentic**: multi-step workflows like find → compare → negotiate → buy.
* **Privacy-friendly**: Can optionally run offline on Edge devices.
* **Highly extensible**: Add loyalty tracking, sustainable impact estimators, or business resale optimization.
