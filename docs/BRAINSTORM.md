**Reason not selected**: Qualcomm track offered better AI integration opportunities

### Qubic Track - Quantum Computing
**Focus**: Quantum computing applications
**Fit**: Low - outside our current expertise
**Reason not selected**: Requires specialized quantum knowledge

## üìä Technical Evolution

### Original Tech Stack Vision
- **Backend**: FastAPI + FastAI for model inference
- **AI/ML**: Multiple Llama models + custom fine-tuning
- **Infrastructure**: Vultr Managed PostgreSQL + Object Storage
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript for admin dashboard
- **Monitoring**: Custom analytics and user behavior tracking

### Implemented Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI with clean architecture
- **AI/ML**: Groq API with Llama 3.1 (cloud-hosted)
