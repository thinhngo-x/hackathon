## Project Concept

**Multi-Agent AI System for Customer Success Workflows**

A sophisticated ticket reporting and classification system that automates customer success workflows, from onboarding to retention, using modern AI and cloud infrastructure.

### Core Problem & Solution

**Problem**: Integrating new software or frameworks is often complex, manual, and time-consuming. Users face steep learning curves, struggle with configuration, and encounter unaddressed technical roadblocks.

**Solution**: An intelligent system that automates 80% of the technical integration, setup, and adoption process for new software and frameworks, providing personalized, proactive guidance and context-aware support.

### Technical Implementation

- **Function**: Guides users through setup and configuration
- **Capabilities**:
  - Analyzes error descriptions and technical context
  - Classifies issues by department and severity
  - Provides intelligent routing and suggested actions
  - Uses Groq API with Llama 3.1 for real-time analysis

#### Agent 2: Contextual Support Router (Report Service)
- **Function**: Intelligently categorizes and routes technical inquiries
- **Capabilities**:
  - Auto-classifies support tickets by urgency and complexity
  - Routes to appropriate departments (backend, frontend, database, etc.)
  - Integrates with external ticket systems
  - Provides structured reporting and analytics

5. **Developer-Friendly**: Modern tooling and comprehensive documentation

### Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple worker processes
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx/HAProxy configuration
- **Cloud Deployment**: Docker, AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run support
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, metrics, and logging

### Demo Capabilities

1. **Error Classification**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/classify" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"error_description": "Database connection timeout", "error_message": "Connection refused"}'
   ```

2. **Report Submission**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/reports/mock" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Critical Bug", "description": "System crashes on startup"}'
   ```

3. **Combined Operations**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/combined/classify-and-send" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Login Issue", "description": "Users cannot authenticate"}'
   ```

### Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Analytics**: Usage patterns and adoption metrics
2. **Integration Monitoring**: Track software integration health
3. **Predictive Support**: Identify potential issues before they occur
4. **Multi-Language Support**: Expand beyond Python ecosystem
5. **Visual Debugging**: Screen recording and visual guide generation
